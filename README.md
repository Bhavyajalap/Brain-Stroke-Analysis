#üß† Brain Stroke Analysis & Prediction
This project aims to analyze and predict brain strokes using machine learning techniques. Brain strokes are life-threatening medical emergencies, and early prediction can be life-saving. By analyzing patient data ‚Äî such as age, gender, glucose levels, and lifestyle ‚Äî we can identify patterns that contribute to stroke risk and implement early preventive measures.

Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following features:

Feature	Description
Age	              Age of the patient (years)
Gender	          Male or Female
Hypertension	    1 = Yes, 0 = No
Heart Disease	    1 = Yes, 0 = No
Ever Married	    Yes or No
Work Type	        Private, Self-employed, or Govt_job
Residence Type  	Rural or Urban
Avg Glucose Level	Average glucose level (mmol/L)
BMI	              (kg/m¬≤)
Smoking Status	  Smokes, Never smoked, Formerly smoked, etc.
Stroke	1 = Stroke occurred, 0 = No stroke

üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The following visualizations were used to explore the dataset:

Bar Plot: Category-wise comparisons

Pair Plot: Relationships between features

Histogram: Distribution of continuous variables

Boxplot: Outlier detection and spread

Heatmap: Correlation matrix

ü§ñ Machine Learning Models Used
Four ML models were trained to predict whether a person is at risk of a stroke:

Algorithm	Accuracy
Logistic Regression	94%
Decision Tree	90%
Random Forest	94%
K-Nearest Neighbors	94%

All models were trained after appropriate preprocessing and scaling of the dataset.

‚úÖ Conclusion
The machine learning models ‚Äî particularly Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and K-Nearest ‚Äî showed promising performance with high accuracy (94%). This suggests that ML can be a powerful tool in identifying individuals at risk of brain stroke and enabling early intervention.
